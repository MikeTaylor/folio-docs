# folio-docs

## The past

I have often found myself writing documents about aspects of FOLIO that have general applicability, but arise in the context of a specific project. Those documents typically get written in the `doc` directory of whatever project I was working on at the time, which makes them hard to find later. Some examples:

* 2017-01-12 -- [A modest proposal for error formats in FOLIO](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/error-formats-in-folio.md) in `okapi`
* 2018-03-14 -- [Uninstalling a running module](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-graphql/blob/master/doc/remove-running-modules.md) in `mod-graphql`
* 2018-03-27 -- [An attempt to enumerate the requirements for FOLIO modules](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/module-requirements.md) in `okapi`
* 2018-10-10 -- [Developing with a Vagrant box](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-graphql/blob/master/doc/developing-with-a-vagrant-box.md) and [a related transcript](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-graphql/blob/master/doc/developing-with-a-vagrant-box--transcript.txt) in `mod-graphql`
* 2019-11-14 -- [Port-Forwarding for development](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-graphql/blob/master/doc/port-forwarding-for-development.md) in `mod-graphql`
* 2020-06-22 -- [Overview of ways to do automated UI testing](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/blob/master/doc/testing-notes.md) in `ui-courses`
* 2020-07-07 -- [Exposition of UI testing using Cypress and Yakbak](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/blob/master/doc/testing-with-cypress.md) in `ui-courses`
* 2020-10-02 -- [A proposal to separate interfaces from implementations](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/proposal-to-separate-interfaces.md) in `okapi`
* 2021-01-14 -- [Disabling and undeploying unwanted FOLIO modules](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/unwanted-modules.md) in `okapi`

* 2021-09-22 -- [Notes on UI testing using Jest and RTL](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-plugin-eusage-reports/blob/master/doc/testing-with-jest-and-rtl.md) in `ui-plugin-eusage-reports`
* 2022-02-14 -- [Running against a VM backend with a side-loaded backend module](https://github.com/indexdata/ui-harvester-admin/blob/main/doc/running.md) in `ui-harvester-admin`
* 2022-03-18 -- [Re-establishing permissions after changing the module descriptor](https://github.com/indexdata/ui-harvester-admin/blob/main/doc/permissions.md) in `ui-harvester-admin`
* 2022-07-06 -- [Deciding what modules to release for a new FOLIO flower release](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-ldp/blob/master/doc/new-folio-release.md) in `ui-ldp`.

As well as being an index to existing documents of this kind, the present repository is a holding area for new documents, which can then be moved somewhere more official as and when that is appropriate.

## The present

From now on, I am going to put such documents in this repository. Here is what exists so far:

* 2022-11-04 -- [Configuration and customization in FOLIO](doc/customization.md)
* 2022-11-08 -- [Fixing the security problem in mod-configuration](doc/fixing-mod-configuration.md)
* 2022-11-16 -- [A user-interface for FOLIO customization](doc/customization-ui.md)
