# folio-docs

## The past

I have often found myself writing documents about aspects of FOLIO that have general applicability, but arise in the context of a specific project. Those documents typically get written in the `doc` directory of whatever project I was working on at the time, which makes them hard to find later. Some examples:

* 2017-01-12 -- [A modest proposal for error formats in FOLIO](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/error-formats-in-folio.md) in `okapi`
* 2017-10-05 -- [White paper: the FOLIO workflow engine](https://github.com/indexdata/mod-workflow/blob/master/doc/folio-workflow-engine.md)

As well as being an index to existing documents of this kind, the present repository is a holding area for new documents, which can then be moved somewhere more official as and when that is appropriate.

## The present

From now on, I am going to put such documents in this repository. Here is what exists so far:

* 2022-11-04 -- [Configuration and customization in FOLIO](doc/customization.md)
* 2022-11-08 -- [Fixing the security problem in mod-configuration](doc/fixing-mod-configuration.md)
* 2022-11-16 -- [A user-interface for FOLIO customization](doc/customization-ui.md)
